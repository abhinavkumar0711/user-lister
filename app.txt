The application allows users to subscribe to a newsletter by entering their email address in an input field and clicking a subscribe button. The application then stores the email address in json file on the server and sends a success message to the user.

Here are the step-by-step instructions for using the application:

The user navigates to the application URL in their web browser.
The application loads the HTML page and displays a form that includes an input field for the user's email address and a subscribe button.
The user enters their email address in the input field and clicks the subscribe button.
The subscribe button triggers a JavaScript function that sends an HTTP POST request to the server. 
The server receives the HTTP POST request and extracts the Name and email address from the query parameter.
The server stores the email address in a json file on the server using the Node.js fs module.
The server sends a success message back to the client, which is displayed as an alert message in the user's web browser.
If the user enters an invalid email address (i.e. one that does not contain an "@" symbol), the JavaScript function displays an error message in the user's web browser.
The details of subscribed users is displayed on /user.html.
